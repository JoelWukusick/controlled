# Light-Panel Control
## Owners of LED light-panels can create and save settings.

#### This online app will help users design presets for their LED light-panel, and control their panel from any browser. It will have calculations for gradients as well as a custom control of every led in a 12 X 12 matrix.

#### Controlling custom led panels can be cumbersome, this will let customers create and save presets so they can change their settings from any device with a browser.

### *"This app is a masterpiece, everyone will buy LED strips to use this controller."* -Joel Wukusick, MyCo

#### Creating custom light displays is so easy, it's almost automatic.

### *"I actually went back and paid MyCo more than they were asking after using this. It's so amazing. I feel like I would have cheated them by getting all this value at that price"* -Ebenezer Scrooge, Customer

#### Light Panel Control will launch March 2nd, 2020. Talk with Joel to get your copy.
